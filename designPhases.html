                <h1>Our goals</h1>
                <p>In ISIA the students uses the spaces even during non-classroom hours, and these spaces should include refreshments. So we are trying to find it filling the lack of it in ISIA. At the same time a space could be used as a meeting space for students and tourists that visit the building frequently.</p>
                <h1>Target</h1>
                <p>We mainly considered ISIA students and visitors to the structure as possible customers
                The place should have this architectural features:<br>
                - Reception area;<br>
                - Place to take a break, to create a convivial and relaxed atmosphere;<br>
                - Space for the kitchen;<br>
                - Light space;<br>
                - Bathrooms should be close by.</p>

                <h1>Proposal for places</h1>
                <p>We initially considered this places:<br>
                - Ex-library<br>
                - Roof Garden<br>
                - Courtyard</p>

                </div>
                <p>We made some sketches for these proposals</p>

                </div></div>
                <p>But after a closer look at the structure, we decided to take advantage of an unusual but very interesting angle

                <h1>Counter Realization</h1>
                <p>So we began to make a custom counter for that peculiar corner of ISIA that was untapped and yet literally under the eyes of all</p>

                <h1>Logo design</h1>
                <p>Parallel to the physical realization, we developed our logo that should fully represent the nature of our new egregation point</p>
