        <h1>Concept</h1>
            <p>We decided to use food with its convivial function and as a means of creating relaxed and informal relationships. We wanted to recreate the sunny and confidential environment of the places that students usually frequent but instead of outside within the space of the isia.</p>
            <p>There was an initial exploration of the spaces of the school that were
                on the one hand suitable for the setting up of a bar (close to the bathrooms, with availability of water and electricity and accessible)
                and on the other hand that it was an original place, not enhanced but characteristic.</p>
                <div class="box" id="box02">
                    <h1>Why Oblò?</h1>
                    <div class="picture" id="About01">
                    </div>
                <p>Oblò translated means porthole and in addition to directly recalling the particular small window next to the counter is also a good metaphor for our concept.
                <p>Oblò is located almost hidden in the under stairs of ISIA but under everyone’s eyes and overlooking the inner courtyard, constantly frequented by all students, the concept behind the logo is to recall the shape of the porthole but changing the shape from circle to square to also recall the shape of the counter and its unusual location almost embedded in the very walls of the school.</p>
                <p>Our counter thus becomes a seamless part of the school, blending seamlessly with the rest of the environment.</p>

                <h1>The Event</h1>
                <p>But all this theory would be worthless without a real isiotic aperitif, and so we organized an inaugural aperitif to put into practice our idea of creating a convivial space where we can consolidate or weave new relationships among students, professors, and anyone who can hold interesting conversations!

                </div>
                <p>Indeed we got what we wanted, an opportunity to talk in a relaxed way and to get to know each other from a different and perhaps more sincere perspective, free from the usual relational patterns within the classroom and school</p>
